    "text": "Forthcoming in Public Opinion Quarterly, co-authored with Tobias Heide-Jørgensen\nAbstract: We study whether communication that attributes extreme weather to climate change along with individuals’ personal weather experiences can mobilize increased support for climate change action and policies. Using a preregistered representative survey experiment from Denmark, we randomly assign respondents to two treatments: (a) a hot weather prime that asks them to recall the extreme Danish summer of 2018 and (b) contextualizing information that links extreme weather events to climate change. We find that priming past heat experience does not foster increased climate awareness, opinions, or willingness to act or pay. We also fail to find that climate communication strengthens the effect of heat experience on climate attitudes or matters on its own. We argue, and provide tentative evidence, that this is because people in northern regions often recall heat spells as something pleasant rather than perceiving them as a risk. Similar results were obtained using quasi-experimental data on recent local temperature deviations instead of past heat experiences. Overall, the results suggest that what is objectively and meteorologically extreme may subjectively invoke positive feelings and therefore not increase support for climate action. We discuss the implications for climate communication and opinion formation.\n\n\n\nPublished in Political Behavior (2024) [link to open access article]\nAbstract: Human-caused global warming exacerbates extreme weather events, but evidence of their impact on political behavior is limited. This article presents a twofold study of the effects of severe storm surge flooding on pro-climate voting in Danish elections. Using difference-in-differences research designs and administrative data, the article shows how the electoral effects of local flooding depends on the intensity of the experience. Voting for pro-climate parties in Danish national elections increased by around 2-3 percentage points in polling districts with flooding. Voting for local election candidates, who communicate a priority for climate issues and can have substantial influence on municipal climate policy, also increased four years after the flood, however only in districts with extreme flooding. Severe flooding increased the relative election chances of marginal pro-climate candidates by around five percentage points. Responsiveness to local flooding depends on the local extremity of the event and, possibly, local citizens’ pre-existing climate awareness. The ostensibly modest effects are illustrative of electoral decision-making, even if the practical political and environmental implications are limited. By raising the salience of climate issues, personal flooding experience shapes voting behavior in a changing climate.\n\n\n\nPublished in International Journal of Public Opinion Research (2024), co-authored with Jakob Dreyer [link to article]\nAbstract: Decision-makers and commentators are calling Europe’s present political predicament a polycrisis: a period of overlapping, urgent, and mutually reinforcing crises with climate change and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as key challenges. Our knowledge about how citizens perceive and respond to polycrisis is limited. This paper presents a preregistered survey experiment from Denmark with 4,017 nationally representative respondents. We study crisis perceptions and willingness to act for the climate and Ukraine after concurrently priming both issues. Overall, threat perceptions increase but so does inaction. Climate change drives increases in threat perception and worry, while the war in Ukraine drives a reduction in willingness to act and pay. The results challenge the ‘finite pool of worry’ hypothesis, which presupposes that worry about new, urgent threats will crowd out worry about existing problems, especially in case of climate change. Rather willingness to act under polycrisis is issue-specific and shaped by concrete pocketbook costs, as our experimental evidence illustrates. The results also have important policy implications at a time when decision-makers frequently justify political action through polycrisis discourse.\n\n\n\nPublished in Electoral Studies (2023), co-authored with Kasper M. Hansen [link to open access article]\nAbstract: Ostensibly random and trivial experiences of everyday life, e.g., local weather, can have significant political consequences. First, we present a comprehensive meta-analysis of 34 studies of electoral turnout and rainfall – the vast majority demonstrating a negative association. Secondly, we present a new analysis of a voter panel with validated turnout for a complete electorate merged with fine-grained meteorological observations to show that Election Day rainfall reduces turnout by 0.95 percentage points per centimeter, while more sunshine increases turnout. Marginal voters (young voters) are up to six times more susceptible to bad weather and respond more positively to pleasant weather. Thus, bad weather exacerbates unequal democratic participation by pushing low-propensity voters to abstain. Efforts to include marginal voters therefore ought to be intensified during poor weather, and elections could even be moved to seasons with more pleasant weather to improve participatory equality.\n\n\n\nPublished in International Journal of Public Opinion Research (2022) [link to article]\nAbstract: When a political issue rises to the top of the public agenda, it puts pressure on decisionmakers, shifts power to actors engaging with the issue, and opens a window of opportunity. This article shows that online mass media contributed to the rapid rise of climate change on European public agendas in and around 2019. It also suggests that issue publics, i.e., particularly concerned and interested citizens, were influenced most. Conversely, citizens without strong climate opinions are not subject to influence from intensive media coverage. The results come from vector autoregression (VAR) models that take advantage of unique daily salience time series. The time series are constructed from weekly repeated nationally representative surveys of the public (N=25,445) and online news articles (N=6,905) by a dominant mass media news outlet that boasts a particularly large, trustful, and diverse audience. Traditional mass media can retain a powerful agenda-setting role even in increasingly fragmented media environments. But the target of their influence depends on the issue and the composition of corresponding issue publics, plausibly due in part to individual differences in use and processing of information about the issue.\n\n\n\nPublished in West European Politics (2021) [link to article]\nAbstract: Previous research has shown that we believe more in the reality of climate change when we experience warmer-than-usual temperatures. This reflects a psychological process in which easily accessible information from personal weather experiences is used as a heuristic to form climate opinions. This paper replicates and extends upon a research design and results of Egan and Mullin to provide the first systematic European study of the Local Warming Effect. Based on data from 12 European countries, the analysis shows that when objective temperatures increase by two standard deviations (5°C) relative to normal temperatures, climate opinions are strengthened by around 0.5–1.0 percentage points – comparable to the effect of a full step to the left on a 0–10 political ideology scale."

    "text": "Abstract\nGlobal climate change is an increasingly large part of our lives and will remain so in the future. How will it affect us as political beings? This PhD dissertation investigates how citizens’ personal experience with weather and climate shapes political opinions, beliefs, and behavior toward climate change. Public support for the green transition is pivotal, and lack of public support can be an important barrier to climate action and adaptation. Because climate change is abstract, complex, and relatively new as a major political issue, political elites and the media could be driving public climate opinion. However, it is possible for voters to circumvent elite discourse and, instead, experience climate change directly in extreme and unusual weather events that are exacerbated by global warming. The changing weather, thus, has political causes, but what are the political consequences? Weather experiences provide unmediated information about climate change, but is personal experience translated into pro-climate opinions and behavior? Yes, it is, as the dissertation demonstrates.\nThe dissertation’s overall research question is: How are voters’ climate opinions and behavior shaped by media coverage of climate change and personal weather experiences? The key findings show that personal experience with more extreme weather, including high temperatures and local flooding, and increased media coverage of climate change raise climate concern and cause a shift toward more pro-climate beliefs, opinions, and behavior. As climate change is experienced more, now and in the future, this can foster public support for the creation of a more sustainable society. This is crucial knowledge because it shows that climate change, as it worsens, helps creating the conditions for a green transition. In that sense, the dissertation is relatively optimistic about the nature of the public’s response to climate change. It contributes with knowledge about how individuals translate their own personal experiences into political opinions and behavior, which is crucial to find viable political solutions to climate change.\nThe dissertation consists of a project frame, which sets the research questions up against existing theory and knowledge gaps, and four self-containing research articles: Article 1: Media, Article 2: Temperature, and Article 4: Turnout are published in International Journal of Public Opinion Research, West European Politics, and Electoral Studies, respectively, and Article 3: Flooding is under review at American Political Science Review. The four articles creatively combine large datasets and apply research designs that facilitate causal inference about the effects of personal experience on climate opinions and behavior. Denmark is the dissertation’s core research case. It is a comparatively well-functioning political system with low levels of political polarization, high political participation and trust, high consumption of non-partisan public service news, and high degrees of consensus about the reality and fundamental seriousness of climate change. Studying voters’ responses to climate change in a country like Denmark is ostensibly a conservative test of weather effects because of comparatively strong preexisting pro-climate opinions and a mild climate, which makes weather experiences less forceful than in other regions. Thus, the positive effects of weather and media coverage demonstrated in Denmark likely also apply to contexts with less attitude ceiling effects and stronger weather experiences. Meanwhile, widespread climate literacy and low levels of political polarization among voters, media, and political elites, may be the key to constructive public responses to climate change, as people see and feel the climate more in their everyday lives and local communities."
