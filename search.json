    "text": "2. How weather experiences strengthen climate opinions in Europe\nPublished in West European Politics (2021) [link to article]\nAbstract: Previous research has shown that we believe more in the reality of climate change when we experience warmer-than-usual temperatures. This reflects a psychological process in which easily accessible information from personal weather experiences is used as a heuristic to form climate opinions. This paper replicates and extends upon a research design and results of Egan and Mullin to provide the first systematic European study of the Local Warming Effect. Based on data from 12 European countries, the analysis shows that when objective temperatures increase by two standard deviations (5°C) relative to normal temperatures, climate opinions are strengthened by around 0.5–1.0 percentage points – comparable to the effect of a full step to the left on a 0–10 political ideology scale.\n\n\n3. When the election rains out and how bad weather excludes marginal voters from turning out with Kasper M. Hansen\nUnder review\nAbstract: Ostensibly random and trivial experiences of everyday life, e.g., local weather, can have significant political consequences. First, a comprehensive meta-analysis of 34 studies on rainfall and electoral turnout shows that while the majority demonstrate a negative association, the inverse variance-weighted average effect suggests a puzzling 0.003%-points increase in turnout per centimeter of rainfall. Secondly, new analysis of an individual-level voter panel with validated turnout for a complete electorate merged with fine-grained meteorological observations shows that Election Day rainfall reduces turnout by 0.95%-points per centimeter, while more sunshine increases turnout. Marginal voters (young voters) are up to six times more susceptible to bad weather and respond more positively to pleasant weather. Thus, bad weather can exacerbate unequal democratic participation by pushing low-propensity voters to abstain, and efforts to include marginal voters should therefore be intensified during poor Election Day weather. Elections may even be moved to seasons with more pleasant weather.\n\n\n4. Voting for pro-climate parties and candidates in response to extreme flooding experience\nWorking paper (available upon request)\nAbstract: Floods, heatwaves, droughts, and other extreme weather events are becoming more frequent, enduring, and intense due to human-caused global heating. While previous research has shown how first-hand experiences of such events influence citizens’ climate-related attitudes and perceptions, studies of their impact on actual behavior are few and reach mixed conclusions. This paper contributes with a twofold study that investigates the effects of an unusually destructive and salient storm surge event caused by a 2013 northern European winter storm on pro-climate voting in Danish elections. Employing a difference-in-differences design at the level of all 1,386 polling stations, Study 1 shows how the parliamentary election vote share of the pro-climate parties in the left-green bloc—which holds clear, persistent issue ownership on climate-related issues—increased by at least 1.5 percentage points in flooded communities. This effect furthermore increases with higher local flooding intensity. Study 2 employs a triple difference design at the level of all 9,554 local election candidates to show how flooding exposure produced a distinct electoral benefit for pro-climate candidates. Specifically, the storm surge caused the gap in election chances between candidates running on a pro-climate policy platform and non-climate candidates to increase by 5.5 percentage points in heavily flooded communities. Within the pro-climate parties, where climate change is a more salient concern, the gap is 11.2 percentage points. Together, the results paint a picture of significant behavioral change induced by extreme weather experience that shifts voters towards parties and candidates with pro-climate agendas.\n\n\n5.
