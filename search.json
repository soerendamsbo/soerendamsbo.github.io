    "text": "1. When the election rains out and how bad weather excludes marginal voters from turning out with Kasper M. Hansen\nPublished in Electoral Studies (2023) [link to open access article]\nAbstract: Ostensibly random and trivial experiences of everyday life, e.g., local weather, can have significant political consequences. First, we present a comprehensive meta-analysis of 34 studies of electoral turnout and rainfall – the vast majority demonstrating a negative association. Secondly, we present a new analysis of a voter panel with validated turnout for a complete electorate merged with fine-grained meteorological observations to show that Election Day rainfall reduces turnout by 0.95 percentage points per centimeter, while more sunshine increases turnout. Marginal voters (young voters) are up to six times more susceptible to bad weather and respond more positively to pleasant weather. Thus, bad weather exacerbates unequal democratic participation by pushing low-propensity voters to abstain. Efforts to include marginal voters therefore ought to be intensified during poor weather, and elections could even be moved to seasons with more pleasant weather to improve participatory equality.\n\n\n2. Mass media influence on the rapid rise of climate change\nPublished in International Journal of Public Opinion Research (2022) [link to article]\nAbstract: When a political issue rises to the top of the public agenda, it puts pressure on decisionmakers, shifts power to actors engaging with the issue, and opens a window of opportunity. This article shows that online mass media contributed to the rapid rise of climate change on European public agendas in and around 2019. It also suggests that issue publics, i.e., particularly concerned and interested citizens, were influenced most. Conversely, citizens without strong climate opinions are not subject to influence from intensive media coverage. The results come from vector autoregression (VAR) models that take advantage of unique daily salience time series. The time series are constructed from weekly repeated nationally representative surveys of the public (N=25,445) and online news articles (N=6,905) by a dominant mass media news outlet that boasts a particularly large, trustful, and diverse audience. Traditional mass media can retain a powerful agenda-setting role even in increasingly fragmented media environments. But the target of their influence depends on the issue and the composition of corresponding issue publics, plausibly due in part to individual differences in use and processing of information about the issue.\n\n\n3. How weather experiences strengthen climate opinions in Europe\nPublished in West European Politics (2021) [link to article]\nAbstract: Previous research has shown that we believe more in the reality of climate change when we experience warmer-than-usual temperatures. This reflects a psychological process in which easily accessible information from personal weather experiences is used as a heuristic to form climate opinions. This paper replicates and extends upon a research design and results of Egan and Mullin to provide the first systematic European study of the Local Warming Effect. Based on data from 12 European countries, the analysis shows that when objective temperatures increase by two standard deviations (5°C) relative to normal temperatures, climate opinions are strengthened by around 0.5–1.0 percentage points – comparable to the effect of a full step to the left on a 0–10 political ideology scale.\n\n\n4. Pro-climate voting in response to local flooding\nWorking paper (available upon request)\nAbstract: Floods, heatwaves, droughts, and other extreme weather events are becoming more frequent, enduring, and intense due to human-caused global heating. While previous research has shown that first-hand experiences of such events influence citizens’ climate-related attitudes and perceptions, studies of their impact on actual behavior are few in numbers and reach mixed conclusions. This paper contributes with a twofold study that investigates the effects of an unusually destructive and salient northern European storm surge event in 2013 on pro-climate voting in Danish elections. Employing a difference-in-differences design at the level of all 1,386 polling districts, Study 1 shows how the parliamentary election vote share of the pro-climate parties in the left-green bloc —who hold clear, persistent issue ownership on climate-related issues—increased by around two percentage points in flooded communities. The effect increases with higher local flooding intensity and is robust to matching on a range of potential confounders. Study 2 employs a triple difference design at the level of 11,722 local election candidates, with vote shares and flooding measured at 1,365 different polling stations, to show how local flooding produced a distinct electoral advantage for pro-climate candidates. The vote share gap between pro-climate candidates and non-climate candidates increased by around 0.2 percentage points, equivalent to a three percentage points increase in election chances for the median candidate. In a series of robustness checks, I show that the pro-climate voting effect is not driven by, e.g., spurious votes for new, coincidentally pro-climate candidates, pro-welfare voting, a reward for incumbents, strategic party behavior, and that it is robust to alternative ways of defining the flooding treatment. Together, these studies show how flooding experience, by raising the salience of climate-related concerns, can have environmentally, socially, and politically significant behavioral effects.\n\n\n5. Extreme Heat Does Not Foster Pro-Climate Attitudes and Behavior When It Is Experienced as Pleasant with Tobias Heide-Jørgensen\nWorking paper (available upon request)\nAbstract: This paper examines whether communication that links extreme weather with climate change activates personal weather experiences and fosters increased public support for the green transition. Using a preregistered representative survey experiment fielded in Denmark, we find that priming past heat experience does not foster increased climate awareness, opinions, or willingness to act or pay. We argue and provide tentative evidence that this is because people in northern regions recall heat spells as something pleasant rather than a risk. Secondly, attributing extreme weather to climate change only promotes climate action, when it emphasizes personal heat-related health risks. No evidence was found that climate communication strengthens the connection between heat experience and climate attitudes and behavior. Finally, the effect of recent temperatures on climate awareness is eliminated by climate information. Overall, these findings suggest that what is objectively and meteorologically extreme may subjectively invoke positive feelings instead. We conclude by discussing the implications of this for climate attitude formation and communication.\n\n\n6. Willingness to Sacrifice for the Climate and Ukraine: How polycrisis makes us anxious but hesitant with Jakob Dreyer\nWorking paper (available upon request)\nAbstract: Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and global warming have made observers and decision-makers describe Europe’s present political predicament as a polycrisis: a period of overlapping, urgent, and mutually reinforcing challenges. However, little is known about how the public perceives and responds in the face of polycrisis. To investigate this, the article presents a preregistered survey experiment with 4,017 representative respondents in Denmark. We invoke issue linkage between climate change and the Ukraine war by varying the order and combination of two similar vignettes and questions sets – one about the War in Ukraine and one about global warming. By including a real-life lottery the design helps bridge the salience-action gap in experimental surveys. Overall, the results show that linking global warming and the war increases threat perception, but reduces willingness to sacrifice. Global warming drives the increase in threat perception, while Ukraine drives the reduction in willingness to sacrifice. The results thus challenge the dominant ‘finite pool of worry’ theory, which presupposes that new challenges will crowd out worry and support for more distant and cumulative threats like global warming. They also challenge the alternative hypothesis that polycrisis increases willingness to sacrifice across the board. Instead, willingness to sacrifice appears to be issue-specific and constrained by a ‘finite pool of resources’. To make sense of these findings it is hypothesized that issue linkage (polycrisis) leads to higher levels of general anxiety, which tends to make people hesitant to act. The results have important, and quite counterintuitive, policy implications at a time when polycrisis discourse often is used to justify political sacrifice."
