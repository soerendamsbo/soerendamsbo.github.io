Hi there! I was a PhD fellow at the [Department of Political Science](https://politicalscience.ku.dk/), University of Copenhagen (UCPH), where I studied political behavior, voters, and public opinion on climate change until I handed in my PhD dissertation in September 2023. 

My PhD dissertation, titled '*Political Weather: How experiencing climate change shapes our political lives*', will be publicly defended on January 9, 2024 ([event link](https://politicalscience.ku.dk/events/soeren-damsbo-svendsen-defends-his-phd-thesis)). The 330-page thesis can be downloaded [here](https://web.tresorit.com/l/aaPc9#k8uymX77GQKNWTFFhGq_Vw) with the password "*climatechange*".

Currently, I am working with professor Kasper M. Hansen on The Danish Turnout Project. You can read more about my research [here](https://soerendamsbo.github.io/research.html).
