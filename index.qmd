Hi there! Until I handed in my PhD dissertation in September 2023, I was a PhD fellow at the [Department of Political Science, University of Copenhagen (UCPH)](https://politicalscience.ku.dk/), where I have been studying political behavior, voters, and public opinion on climate change.

My PhD thesis is titled '*Political Weather: How experiencing climate change shapes our political lives*'. It was submitted in September 2023 and will be defended in January 2024 at the University of Copenhagen.

Currently, I am working with Kasper M. Hansen as a research assistant on The Danish Turnout Project. You can read more about my research [here](https://soerendamsbo.github.io/research.html).
