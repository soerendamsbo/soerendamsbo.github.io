### __1. Mass media influence on the rapid rise of climate change__

<!-- *Published in International Journal of Public Opinion Research (2022)* -->
*Forthcoming in International Journal of Public Opinion Research*

**Abstract:** When a political issue rises to the top of the public agenda, it puts pressure on decisionmakers, shifts power to actors engaging with the issue, and opens a window of opportunity. This article shows that online mass media contributed to the rapid rise of climate change on European public agendas in and around 2019. It also suggests that issue publics, i.e., particularly concerned and interested citizens, were influenced most. Conversely, citizens without strong climate opinions are not subject to influence from intensive media coverage. The results come from vector autoregression (VAR) models that take advantage of unique daily salience time series. The time series are constructed from weekly repeated nationally representative surveys of the public (N=25,445) and online news articles (N=6,905) by a dominant mass media news outlet that boasts a particularly large, trustful, and diverse audience. Traditional mass media can retain a powerful agenda-setting role even in increasingly fragmented media environments. But the target of their influence depends on the issue and the composition of corresponding issue publics, plausibly due in part to individual differences in use and processing of information about the issue.

### __2. How weather experiences strengthen climate opinions in Europe__

*Published in West European Politics (2021)*

**Abstract:** Previous research has shown that we believe more in the reality of climate change when we experience warmer-than-usual temperatures. This reflects a psychological process in which easily accessible information from personal weather experiences is used as a heuristic to form climate opinions. This paper replicates and extends upon a research design and results of Egan and Mullin to provide the first systematic European study of the Local Warming Effect. Based on data from 12 European countries, the analysis shows that when objective temperatures increase by two standard deviations (5°C) relative to normal temperatures, climate opinions are strengthened by around 0.5–1.0 percentage points – comparable to the effect of a full step to the left on a 0–10 political ideology scale.

### __3. When the election rains out and how bad weather excludes marginal voters from turning out__ with [Kasper M. Hansen](https://www.kaspermhansen.eu)

*Under review*

**Abstract:** Ostensibly random and trivial experiences of everyday life, such as local weather, can have significant political consequences. The meta-analysis of 33 studies of rainfall and electoral turnout shows the average effect is -0.76 %-points reduction in the probability of voting per centimeter of rainfall. We apply the first individual-level time series of validated turnout for a complete electorate merged with fine-grained meteorological observations. Bad weather reduce turnout, by -0.84 %-points per centimeter of rainfall. Importantly, marginal voters – specifically young voters except first-time voters – are up to seven times more susceptible to bad weather and also more responsive to pleasant weather (sunshine). Suggesting bad weather can exacerbate inequalities in democratic participation by pushing low-propensity voters to abstain. Thus, efforts to include marginal voters should be intensified at elections with poor weather, and that elections could even be moved to a time with more pleasant Election Day weather.

### __4. Sophisticated voters reward pro-climate parties and candidates in the wake of extreme weather events__ 

*Working paper (draft available upon request)*

**Abstract:** Extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, droughts, and floods, are becoming more frequent, enduring, and intense due to human-caused global heating. While previous research has shown how first-hand experiences of such events influence citizens’ climate-related attitudes and perceptions, studies of their impact on actual behavior reach mixed conclusions. This paper contributes by investigating the effects of an unusually destructive storm surge caused by the 2013 winter storm “Bodil” on voting behavior in Danish elections. Employing a difference-in-differences design at the level of 1,386 polling stations, the analysis shows how the vote share of the incumbent left-green bloc, which has held clear issue ownership over climate change, increased by at least 1.5 percentage points in flood-stricken areas. Moreover, flooding exposure also led to a higher vote share increase for candidates running on pro-climate platforms in subsequent elections. Together, the results suggest that the flood caused affected citizens to shift support towards parties and candidates with a pro-climate agenda rather than, for example, punishing them (blindly) for being incumbents.
