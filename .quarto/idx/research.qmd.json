Hansen](https://www.kaspermhansen.eu)","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\n\n*Published online in Electoral Studies (2022)* [_[link to article](https://sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379422001299)_]\n\n**Abstract:** Ostensibly random and trivial experiences of everyday life, e.g., local weather, can have significant political consequences. First, we present a comprehensive meta-analysis of 34 studies of electoral turnout and rainfall – the vast majority demonstrating a negative association. Secondly, we present a new analysis of a voter panel with validated turnout for a complete electorate merged with fine-grained meteorological observations to show that Election Day rainfall reduces turnout by 0.95 percentage points per centimeter, while more sunshine increases turnout. Marginal voters (young voters) are up to six times more susceptible to bad weather and respond more positively to pleasant weather. Thus, bad weather exacerbates unequal democratic participation by pushing low-propensity voters to abstain. Efforts to include marginal voters therefore ought to be intensified during poor weather, and elections could even be moved to seasons with more pleasant weather to improve participatory equality.\n\n### __2. Mass media influence on the rapid rise of climate change__\n\n*Published in International Journal of Public Opinion Research (2022)* [_[link to article](https://doi.org/10.1080/01402382.2020.1792731)_]\n\n**Abstract:** When a political issue rises to the top of the public agenda, it puts pressure on decisionmakers, shifts power to actors engaging with the issue, and opens a window of opportunity. This article shows that online mass media contributed to the rapid rise of climate change on European public agendas in and around 2019. It also suggests that issue publics, i.e., particularly concerned and interested citizens, were influenced most. Conversely, citizens without strong climate opinions are not subject to influence from intensive media coverage. The results come from vector autoregression (VAR) models that take advantage of unique daily salience time series. The time series are constructed from weekly repeated nationally representative surveys of the public (N=25,445) and online news articles (N=6,905) by a dominant mass media news outlet that boasts a particularly large, trustful, and diverse audience. Traditional mass media can retain a powerful agenda-setting role even in increasingly fragmented media environments. But the target of their influence depends on the issue and the composition of corresponding issue publics, plausibly due in part to individual differences in use and processing of information about the issue.\n\n### __3. How weather experiences strengthen climate opinions in Europe__\n\n*Published in West European Politics (2021)* [_[link to article](https://doi.org/10.1093/ijpor/edac009)_]\n\n**Abstract:** Previous research has shown that we believe more in the reality of climate change when we experience warmer-than-usual temperatures. This reflects a psychological process in which easily accessible information from personal weather experiences is used as a heuristic to form climate opinions. This paper replicates and extends upon a research design and results of Egan and Mullin to provide the first systematic European study of the Local Warming Effect. Based on data from 12 European countries, the analysis shows that when objective temperatures increase by two standard deviations (5°C) relative to normal temperatures, climate opinions are strengthened by around 0.5–1.0 percentage points – comparable to the effect of a full step to the left on a 0–10 political ideology scale.\n\n### __4. Voting for pro-climate parties and candidates in response to extreme flooding experience__ \n\n*Working paper (available upon request)*\n\n**Abstract:** Floods, heatwaves, droughts, and other extreme weather events are becoming more frequent, enduring, and intense due to human-caused global heating. While previous research has shown how first-hand experiences of such events influence citizens’ climate-related attitudes and perceptions, studies of their impact on actual behavior are few and reach mixed conclusions. This paper contributes with a twofold study that investigates the effects of an unusually destructive and salient storm surge event caused by a 2013 northern European winter storm on pro-climate voting in Danish elections. Employing a difference-in-differences design at the level of all 1,386 polling stations, Study 1 shows how the parliamentary election vote share of the pro-climate parties in the left-green bloc—which holds clear, persistent issue ownership on climate-related issues—increased by at least 1.5 percentage points in flooded communities. This effect furthermore increases with higher local flooding intensity. Study 2 employs a triple difference design at the level of all 9,554 local election candidates to show how flooding exposure produced a distinct electoral benefit for pro-climate candidates. Specifically, the storm surge caused the gap in election chances between candidates running on a pro-climate policy platform and non-climate candidates to increase by 5.5 percentage points in heavily flooded communities. Within the pro-climate parties, where climate change is a more salient concern, the gap is 11.2 percentage points. Together, the results paint a picture of significant behavioral change induced by extreme weather experience that shifts voters towards parties and candidates with pro-climate agendas.\n\n### __5. Experimental evidence on limits to climate change communication: heat experience, information, and climate attitudes__ with [Tobias Heide-Jørgensen](https://politicalscience.ku.dk/staff/phd/?pure=en/persons/436278)  \n\n*Work in progress*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper presents evidence from a large-N representative survey experiment fielded in Denmark. The study employs a 2x2 between-subjects design with two treatments: (a) (priming of) personal experience with extreme heat and (b) climate information designed to contextualize weather experience as climate-related and personal relevant. First, priming past heat experience does not increase climate awareness, opinions, or willingness to act and pay. If anything, they tend to decrease, possibly because Danes perceive and recall heat episodes through a \"fun in the sun\" frame, rather than a climate risk frame. Secondly, a climate information vignette, emphasizing heat-related health risks, increases climate attitudes slightly, but not information that only explains the link between climate change and extreme weather. Finally, we have limited knowledge about how experience interacts with information. Our results suggest that information makes no difference for the (null) effect of heat experience. However, it eliminates the (otherwise positive) effect of recent temperatures (the ‘local warming effect’), likely because System 2-thinking is activated and the experience heuristic deactivated. We discuss what we have learned about limits to effective climate communication.  \n\n### __6. The salience-sacrifice paradox: a re-examination of securitization in the face of war and climate polycrisis__ with [Jakob Dreyer](https://politicalscience.ku.dk/staff/phd/?pure=en/persons/414273)\n\n*Work in progress*\n\n**Abstract:** Russia’s invasion of Ukraine coupled with global warming sparked what observers and political actors in Europe describe as a polycrisis: a period of multiple overlapping, urgent, and mutually reinforcing political challenges. Consequently, we witness the return of personal sacrifice in politics, during the biggest decline in real wages in generations. Theories to help us understand the public’s willingness to sacrifice in a polycrisis point in opposing directions, underlying the openness of the predicament. Emphasizing crisis, securitization theory suggests that the threat discourses could justify extraordinary political actions. Emphasizing poly, the pool-of-worry the- ory suggests that citizens are overwhelmed by the multiple crises causing inaction. To shed light on citizens ́ willingness to sacrifice, we conducted a preregistered survey experiment with 4,017 representative respondents in Denmark. In the analysis we detect a threat-sacrifice paradox: respondents perceive climate change as the most important problem, and priming subjects with brief descriptions about climate change and the Ukraine war crowds out willingness to sacrifice for Ukraine, while it increases willingness to sacrifice for the climate. However, concrete willing- ness to make sacrifices for Ukraine is larger, e.g., in terms of actual charity donations, support for a ban on Russian fossil fuels versus a pro-climate carbon tax, and refugee acceptance. To unravel the paradox the paper discusses how the nature of the crises may explain why citizens respond differently and reflects on how the findings may inform the political response going forward.\n\n### __7.
