Hansen](https://www.kaspermhansen.eu)","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\n\n*Published in Electoral Studies (2023)* [_[link to open access article](https://sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379422001299)_]\n\n**Abstract:** Ostensibly random and trivial experiences of everyday life, e.g., local weather, can have significant political consequences. First, we present a comprehensive meta-analysis of 34 studies of electoral turnout and rainfall – the vast majority demonstrating a negative association. Secondly, we present a new analysis of a voter panel with validated turnout for a complete electorate merged with fine-grained meteorological observations to show that Election Day rainfall reduces turnout by 0.95 percentage points per centimeter, while more sunshine increases turnout. Marginal voters (young voters) are up to six times more susceptible to bad weather and respond more positively to pleasant weather. Thus, bad weather exacerbates unequal democratic participation by pushing low-propensity voters to abstain. Efforts to include marginal voters therefore ought to be intensified during poor weather, and elections could even be moved to seasons with more pleasant weather to improve participatory equality.\n\n### __2. Mass media influence on the rapid rise of climate change__\n\n*Published in International Journal of Public Opinion Research (2022)* [_[link to article](https://doi.org/10.1080/01402382.2020.1792731)_]\n\n**Abstract:** When a political issue rises to the top of the public agenda, it puts pressure on decisionmakers, shifts power to actors engaging with the issue, and opens a window of opportunity. This article shows that online mass media contributed to the rapid rise of climate change on European public agendas in and around 2019. It also suggests that issue publics, i.e., particularly concerned and interested citizens, were influenced most. Conversely, citizens without strong climate opinions are not subject to influence from intensive media coverage. The results come from vector autoregression (VAR) models that take advantage of unique daily salience time series. The time series are constructed from weekly repeated nationally representative surveys of the public (N=25,445) and online news articles (N=6,905) by a dominant mass media news outlet that boasts a particularly large, trustful, and diverse audience. Traditional mass media can retain a powerful agenda-setting role even in increasingly fragmented media environments. But the target of their influence depends on the issue and the composition of corresponding issue publics, plausibly due in part to individual differences in use and processing of information about the issue.\n\n### __3. How weather experiences strengthen climate opinions in Europe__\n\n*Published in West European Politics (2021)* [_[link to article](https://doi.org/10.1093/ijpor/edac009)_]\n\n**Abstract:** Previous research has shown that we believe more in the reality of climate change when we experience warmer-than-usual temperatures. This reflects a psychological process in which easily accessible information from personal weather experiences is used as a heuristic to form climate opinions. This paper replicates and extends upon a research design and results of Egan and Mullin to provide the first systematic European study of the Local Warming Effect. Based on data from 12 European countries, the analysis shows that when objective temperatures increase by two standard deviations (5°C) relative to normal temperatures, climate opinions are strengthened by around 0.5–1.0 percentage points – comparable to the effect of a full step to the left on a 0–10 political ideology scale.\n\n### __4. Pro-climate voting in response to extreme flooding__ \n\n*Working paper (available upon request)*\n\n**Abstract:** Floods, heatwaves, droughts, and other extreme weather events are becoming more frequent, enduring, and intense due to human-caused global heating. While previous research has shown how first-hand experiences of such events influence citizens’ climate-related attitudes and perceptions, studies of their impact on actual behavior are few and reach mixed conclusions. This paper contributes with a twofold study that investigates the effects of an unusually destructive and salient storm surge event caused by a 2013 northern European winter storm on pro-climate voting in Danish elections. Employing a difference-in-differences design at the level of all 1,386 polling stations, Study 1 shows how the parliamentary election vote share of the pro-climate parties in the left-green bloc—which holds clear, persistent issue ownership on climate-related issues—increased by at least 1.5 percentage points in flooded communities. This effect furthermore increases with higher local flooding intensity. Study 2 employs a triple difference design at the level of all 9,554 local election candidates to show how flooding exposure produced a distinct electoral benefit for pro-climate candidates. Specifically, the storm surge caused the gap in election chances between candidates running on a pro-climate policy platform and non-climate candidates to increase by 5.5 percentage points in heavily flooded communities. Within the pro-climate parties, where climate change is a more salient concern, the gap is 11.2 percentage points. Together, the results paint a picture of significant behavioral change induced by extreme weather experience that shifts voters towards parties and candidates with pro-climate agendas.\n\n### __5. Extreme heat does not foster climate change worry or policy support when it is experienced as pleasant, not dangerous__ with [Tobias Heide-Jørgensen](https://politicalscience.ku.dk/staff/phd/?pure=en/persons/436278)  \n\n*Working paper (available upon request)*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper tests if climate change communication can activate and increase the salience of personal experiences of extreme weather and thereby foster increased public support for the green transition. Using a pre-registered large-N representative survey experiment fielded in Denmark, the study employs a between-subjects design with two treatments: (a) priming of personal experience with extreme heat and (b) climate information designed to contextualize weather experience as climate-related and personal relevant. First, priming past extreme heat experience does not increase climate awareness, opinions, or willingness to act and pay. If anything, it has a negative effect, which we speculate may reflect that respondents recall heat spells as something pleasant, rather than a risk (a “fun-in-the-sun” frame). Second, a climate information vignette that links extreme weather to global climate change increases support for climate initiatives slightly, but only when it emphasizes personalized heat-related health risks. Finally, our analysis of the interaction between climate information and personal experience suggests that information makes no difference for the (null) effect of past heat experience. The positive effect of recent temperatures (the ‘local warming effect’), on the other hand, is attenuated by the information. We conclude by discussing the implications for climate communication.\n\n### __6. Citizens’ willingness to sacrifice in the face of global warming and war: How polycrisis makes us more anxious but hesitant to act__ with [Jakob Dreyer](https://politicalscience.ku.dk/staff/phd/?pure=en/persons/414273)\n\n*Working paper (available upon request)*\n\n**Abstract:** Russia’s invasion of Ukraine coupled with global warming sparked what  European political observers and actors have described as a polycrisis: a period of multiple overlapping, urgent, and mutually reinforcing political challenges. Consequently, we are witnessing the return of personal sacrifice in politics in a period with the largest declines in real wages in generations. Theoretical predictions of public willingness to sacrifice under polycrisis are ambiguous. Emphasizing crisis, securitization theory suggests that the threat discourses could justify extraordinary political actions and sacrifices. Emphasizing poly, the pool-of-worry thesis suggests that citizens are overwhelmed by multiple crises, which causes inaction. To shed new light on the public’s willingness to sacrifice, we conducted a preregistered survey experiment with 4,017 representative respondents in Denmark. The results reveal a salience-sacrifice paradox: on the one hand, priming subjects with descriptions of climate change and the Ukraine war increases willingness to sacrifice for the climate while crowding out willingness to sacrifice for Ukraine. Moreover, the climate crisis is perceived as a much more important problem. On the other hand, willingness to make concrete sacrifices is substantially larger for Ukraine (e.g., actual charity donations and support for an expensive Russian fossil fuel boycott). To untangle the paradox, we discuss how the different nature of the crises may explain the heterogeneous public response to the polycrisis.\n\n### __7.
